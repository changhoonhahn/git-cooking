1. Rinse and drain Chinese broccoli thoroughly. Cut the leaves roughly, about ½". And slice the stems thinly on an angle, about ⅛".
2. Slice the Chinese sausage on an angle, also about ⅛".
3. Heat a skillet on medium-high and add olive oil. Twirl the pan around to spread the oil somewhat evenly on the pan. Add Chinese sausage and cook for 3 minutes, until it's turned slightly transparent. Remove from pan into a bowl.
4. On the same skillet, add sesame oil and garlic. Let it cook until fragrant, about 12 seconds. Add Chinese broccoli and chicken broth, and let it cooking for 4 minutes, stir occasionally.
5. Add Chinese sausage, sugar, and soy sauce and cook for another 4 minutes.
