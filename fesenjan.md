**notes**
- there are differences between pomegranate molasses and concentrate.

**trials**
4/27/2020
Had concentrate rather than molasses and only 0.5 lbs of walnuts. 
- ~2 lb chicken
- ~0.5 lb walnut
- 1 cup pomegranate concentrate
- 2 onions thinly sliced
Toasted walnuts in oven (ended up burning a bit of it due to uneven oven). 
Ground the waluts with some water. Browned chicken and sauteed onions. Reduced
the ground walnut, water, and pomegranate mixture then put the chicken and onions
back in. Cooked until thickened and chicken was fork tender. Turned out pretty 
good. 1 cup of concentrate was definitely enough.
