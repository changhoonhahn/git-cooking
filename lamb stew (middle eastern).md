* with dried chickpeas soaked for 8hrs, the chickpeas came out a bit undercooked
* overall the recipe came out a bit sweet and quite tomato-y

**2021 Feb 22**

- 10oz of chickpeas soaked for 4 hours and cooked on the stove for 2 hours. Still came out slightly al dente
- reduced honey to 1tbsp
- less liquid (~1cup)

better overall results.
