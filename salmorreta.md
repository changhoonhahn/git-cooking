Paste used as flavor base in paella 

- ~6 Ã±ora dried peppers (new mexico peppers can apparently replace them)
- ~6 cloves garlic
- ~1cup parsley
- 2-3 cups tomato puree (or with red peppers...?)
- 2Tbps olive oil



1. Cook the dried peppers in olive oil
2. Throw in the chopped garlic
3. Once the garlic is browned throw in the parsley and stir until wilted
4. Throw in tomato (or in my case red peppe) puree (which turned out great). 
5. Blend
