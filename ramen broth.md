## shio ramen broth
- 2-3 lbs of chicken amalgamate that includes chicken feet, backbone, and wings
- 2 carrots 
- 1 onion
- 10 garlic
- salt

First boiled the meat to remove the grey gunk that builds up. Then
cooked it 12 mins to for the shredded meat (above). Removed the 
meat then cooked the feet, wings, carcass for another 1 hour. This
results in nice clear and amber shio broth.
