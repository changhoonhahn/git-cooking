## shortcrust pie crust
---
**notes**
- lard is 100% fat
- american butter is ~80% fat
- at least in principle, recipe #1 seems to be more flaky. 
Recipe 2-3 more crumbly.

**trials**
4/19/2020: 
- ~180g flour (ran out of flour)
- 80g butter
- 20g lard
- ~3 tbsp of water

ran out of flour, which made dusting the dough very difficult. Dough was generally
quite sticky and hard to deal with. Crust turned out too crumbly and delicate --- not
enough gluten. Obviously needed more flour to dust. Also, my guess is that I should
have used more water in order for better gluten formation. Keading may have helped.

1. [Pie Dough the Old-Fashioned Way Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/06/old-fashioned-flaky-pie-dough-recipe.html)
- 8 ounces low protein flour
- 1 tbspsugar
- 1 tsp salt
- 8 ounce butter
- 4 ounce fold tap water

mix all the ingredients. The butter should be in 1/2 inch chunks
that are then smashed, not rubbed or cut. Mix together until 
shaggy ball kneading only a little bit. Afterwards roll it out 
and fold it up. Roll out to large rectangle being liberal with
the flour dusting. Envelope fold (thirds) and fold in half 
the other way. Folding provides multi layers. Then fold out 
to shape **then chill in fridge for 2 hrs**. 
This is to preserve the flakes.
