#spanish #pastry #recipe 

- 500 grams flour
- 150 grams of sunflower oil 
- 150 grams milk
- 1 egg
- 8 grams of salt

1. Mix ingredients and knead into one piece. 
2. Let dough rest for 15 min
3. Shape dough into empanadas
4. Oven at 380F


The original recipe is quite a bit of oil. It's like a full cup of 
oil. This results in an oily crumbly dough, which feels quite 
authentic but involves roughly 1 tablespoon of oil per serving. 

I tried a variation with 50 grams of oil. This turned out to be too
little and the dough became pretty hard to knead. I had to pour in 
a few extra table spoons of oil, so this ended up being 60-70 grams
of oil in the end. The empanada crust ended up being less crumbly 
and more crispy. Although this wasn't bad, I think next time use
~100grams of oil for the crumbly texture.
