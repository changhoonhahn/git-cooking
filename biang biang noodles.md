**notes**

- noodles cook very quickly so have everything prepared

**attempts**
4/19/2020: 
55% hydration with 100 gram of flour. Divided dough into balls and rolled them 
before the 2 hour rest. Overall, far better than I expected. There was a bit of
unevenness when stretching out the noodle. The edges stretched out faster than 
the middle. **I think this can be avoided if instead of rolling the divided balls 
out before the rest, I cut them** as the Xian recipe (#2) says.
